# LS3766R-Raspberry-Pi
LS3766R library for Raspberry Pi (updated)

This is a library to interface with the LS3766R 32-BIT QUADRATURE COUNTER for the Raspberry Pi.
The original library is by Federico Bolanos. His original repo is here: https://github.com/fbolanos/LS7366R/blob/master/LS7366R.py
I have changed this library to work with my needs and to update it to work with Python 3 and above.
